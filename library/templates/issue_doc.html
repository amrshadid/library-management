    <h2 style="font-size:25px;text-align: center;color: blue;text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION (Architectural Guidelines & Standards)</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size:20px;text-align: center;">PURPOSE OF THE ARCHITECTURAL GUIDELINES & STANDARDS</h3> 
<p  style="font-size:15px;">
The intent of the design guidelines is to maintain a visually appealing living environment for our entire community.  Our design guidelines serve to familiarize {{association |safe}} Lot owners with the objectives, scope, and application of the overall design review criteria.  The guidelines also establish and encourage specific design creativity within a consistent framework to preserve community property values.
These standards will be enforced to maintain the aesthetic appearance and market appeal of the community, and to thereby preserve the property values of our {{association |safe}} homes. Lot owners should consult and use these design guidelines when preparing their applications for modifications, alterations or improvements.  
By doing so, their applications will comply with {{association |safe}}'s standards, which will in turn facilitate and expedite the review and approval process by the committee. 

Note that our guidelines are specific, detailed and cover many of the typical modification, alteration and improvement projects that Lot owners want to make to their homes and yards.  For example, if a Lot owner desires to add a deck to her dwelling, she can consult the specific section of the Guidelines pertaining to decks and quickly find the acceptable standards for her deck style and construction. 
The Association makes a considerable effort to periodically review and update the design guidelines and to make them as user-friendly as possible.  
Our members and residents can realize significant benefits by reviewing our guidelines and familiarizing themselves with the design and maintenance standards published therein prior to submitting applications for alterations, modifications, or improvements. 
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align: center;color: blue;text-decoration: underline;">ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE </h3>
<p  style="font-size:15px;">
Any exterior modifications to the dwelling, Lot, or any other improvement thereon require the prior approval of the architectural committee. Lot owners are advised that no work on any proposed change which requires an approved application shall begin until the committee has approved the application.  If work is begun prior to approval, 
Lot owners are advised that they may be required to return the property to its former condition at their expense.  If the application is disapproved wholly or in part and either judicial action or arbitration is required to enforce the protective covenants or these design guidelines, the prevailing party in such action or arbitration may be awarded its 
attorney fees and any other costs or expenses related to the proceeding. Approval by the committee shall in no way be deemed an approval of the modification, alteration, or improvement with respect to the location, structural design, suitability of water flow or drainage, location of utilities, or any other aspect of the project which may be governed by federal, state, 
county or local laws, ordinances or regulations.  The scope of the committee review of applications does not include review for compliance with any applicable building and/or zoning codes of any governmental entities.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align: center;color: blue;text-decoration: underline;">EXTERIOR MODIFICATIONS REQUIRING REVIEW AND APPROVAL</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
The review process is not limited to just major additions, alterations or modifications, such as adding (or removal of) a room, deck, or patio.  It also includes such lesser items as changes in color and materials or even  additional landscaping. Approval is also required when an existing item is to be removed such as a tree or structure.  
The Lot owner is responsible for complying with these design guidelines, initiating the reviews and obtaining the required approvals for any modification, alteration or improvement on the dwelling, structures or Lot. There are no exemptions or automatic approvals and each application will be reviewed on an individual basis. 

If there is any doubt as to whether a proposed exterior modification, alteration or improvement is exempt from design review and approval, please seek clarification from the committee before proceeding with the work. This is meant to help residents eliminate costly mistakes if the committee requires the modification, alteration or improvement to be modified or even removed. Clarification should be requested in writing and submitted via email using the contact information below. </p>

<h4 style="font-size:25px;text-align: center;color: blue;text-decoration: underline;">DESIGN REVIEW CRITERIA</h4><p style="font-size:15px;">

In reviewing applications for modifications, alterations or improvements to homes and Lots, the committee will examine the conformance of applications to these design guidelines, as well as to any covenants or use restrictions in the recorded Declaration.  There will be instances where the approval or disapproval of an application is based upon specific permitted or prohibited actions, uses or materials. 
For example, an application to install a chain-link fence may not be approved because the type of fencing material is prohibited by both the Declaration and these design guidelines. </p>
<h4 style="font-size:25px;text-align: center;color: blue;text-decoration: underline;">APPLICATION REVIEW PROCEDURES</h4><p style="font-size:15px;">

Application and review procedures followed by the committee are detailed below. </p>

alteration or improvement; architectural drawings and/or elevation plans, as applicable; county permits as requested, landscape and drainage plans, as needed; material and/or color samples, etc.  These design guidelines and the application form provide guidance with respect to the supporting documentation required for various types of improvements.

GENERAL PROJECT GUIDELINES</p><p style="font-size:15px;">
Prior to beginning any project, all required building permits must be obtained and properly posted. When planning a project that involves any digging, you must first call to have utility lines located and marked. Call ___________. They will notify participating utilities of the upcoming work so that they can locate and mark their underground facilities (power, sewer, cable/FIOS, gas, and water lines) in advance. Calling _________ is a simple step that can make your construction, \
planting, or home improvement project safer while preventing utility outages that can be inconvenient and even dangerous for your neighbors. Visit www.________________ for more information. 
Residents are reminded to construct the improvements in a workmanlike manner in conformance with all applicable building and zoning codes.  For information about building permits, contact _______________________. </p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
The temporary use of roll-off dumpsters during construction is not permitted on roads or streets. Requestors may place these types of containers on their private residential driveway with the following conditions
<ul>
  <li style="font-size:15px;">Advance written notice (email is sufficient) of the intent to use this type of container is provided to the Association including, the dates the unit(s) will be delivered and the intended removal date. 
</li><li style="font-size:15px;">Placement does not block sidewalks, vehicular traffic, or sightlines for vehicular traffic 
</li><li style="font-size:15px;">  The maximum amount of time these units may be employed is two (2) weeks in any calendar year.
</li><li style="font-size:15px;">	Any concrete damaged by the roll-off dumpster on sidewalks and/or driveways shall be fully replaced (not repaired or patched) within ______ (__) days of the removal of the dumpster.
</li>
</ul></p><p style="font-size:15px;">

    If placing on the private residential driveway is not an alternative, then the requestor must receive permission from the appropriate property owner or governmental entity before placing the dumpster.
Contractor signage must meet all covenants located in the Declaration as well as all guidelines found in this document.  Contractors are not permitted to advertise their company or services before, during or after completion of their work on the Lot.  The only signage allowed is that required by a governmental entity to properly post permits.
Commercial vehicles related to any project may not park within the community overnight.  A contractor is considered a visitor or guest of the Lot owners for whom the contractor is working.  The Lot owner is therefore responsible to ensure that the contractor is aware of and complies with all of the Association governing documents, policies, rules and regulations. </p><p style="font-size:15px;">

Lot owners are responsible for any damage and all costs to restore, repair or replace materials within Common Areas, or to Association Property that results from any work performed by a resident or their contractor 
Lot owners are responsible to ensure there is no negative impact to drainage systems or patterns as a result of any exterior modification they may make to their Lot. In addition, Lot owners are required to mitigate any negative drainage impact to adjacent Lots or common area which may occur as a result of any exterior modifications made by the member. No construction materials of any kind may be stored in common parking lots, common areas, in the streets, or other public rights of way. </p><p style="font-size:15px;">

Private Improvements - Public Rights of Way </p><p style="font-size:15px;">

Lot owners are hereby put on notice that the front property lines of most Lots do not extend to the public/private street and are typically located a few feet behind the curb and gutter, or public sidewalk.  Lot owners shall not install, construct or place any private facilities or improvements, including, but not limited to fences, walls, landscaping, pavers, signs, or other decorative improvements and appurtenant facilities within the dedicated public/private street right-of-way.  </p>
<p style="font-size:25px;text-align: center;color: blue;text-decoration: underline;">
